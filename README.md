AnyLink is an enterprise-level remote office sslvpn software that can support multiple people using it online at the same time.

## Repo

> github: https://github.com/paprikkafox/anylink

## Introduction

AnyLink is based on [ietf-openconnect](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mavrogiannopoulos-openconnect-02)
Protocol development, and draws on the development ideas of [ocserv](http://ocserv.gitlab.io/www/index.html) to make it compatible with the AnyConnect client at the same time.

AnyLink uses TLS/DTLS for data encryption, so an RSA or ECC certificate is required. You can apply for a free SSL certificate through Let's Encrypt and TrustAsia.

The AnyLink server is only tested on CentOS 7, CentOS 8, Ubuntu 18.04, and Ubuntu 20.04. If it needs to be installed on other systems, the server needs to support tun/tap.
Function, ip setting command, iptables command.

## Installation

> Students without programming foundation are recommended to download the release package directly and download anylink-deploy.tar.gz from the address below.
>
> https://github.com/paprikkafox/anylink/releases

### Usage issues

>
> For the online environment, you must apply for a secure https certificate (the same type of certificate used by nginx). Private certificate connections are not supported.
>
> There are related client software downloads for group shared files. Other versions have not been tested and normal use is not guaranteed.
>
> Other questions [Go to view](doc/question.md)
>
> Default management background access address https://host:8800 or https://domain name:8800 Default account password admin 123456
>
> For first time use, please visit https://domain name:443 in the browser. After the browser prompts that it is safe, enter [domain name: 443] on the client.

> Database configuration example
>
> Database table structure is automatically generated, no need to manually import (please grant DDL permission)

| db_type | db_source |
|----------|----------------------------------------- ------------------|
| sqlite3 | ./conf/anylink.db |
| mysql | user:password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/anylink?charset=utf8 |
| postgres | user:password@localhost/anylink?sslmode=verify-full |

> Sample configuration file
>
> [conf/server-sample.toml](server/conf/server-sample.toml)

## Upgrade

> Please back up the configuration file `conf` directory and database before upgrading, and stop the service
>
> Replace the old version with the new version of the `anylink` binary
>
> After restarting the service, the upgrade can be completed

## Setting

### Dependency settings

> Server-side dependency installation:
>
> centos: yum install iptables iproute
>
> ubuntu: apt-get install iptables iproute2


### link_mode setting

> One of the following parameters must be set

To select the network mode, you need to configure the `link_mode` parameter, such as `link_mode="tun"`, `link_mode="macvtap"`, `link_mode="tap"(not recommended)` and other parameters.
Different parameters require corresponding settings on the server.

It is recommended to choose tun mode first, followed by macvtap mode, because the client transmits IP layer data and does not need to perform data conversion. tap mode is done in user mode at the link layer to
Data at the IP layer is converted to each other, and performance will be degraded. If you need to enable tap in the virtual machine
mode, please confirm that the virtual machine's network card is enabled in promiscuous mode.

#### tun settings

1. Enable server forwarding

```shell
# The new version supports automatic setting of IP forwarding

# file: /etc/sysctl.conf
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1

# Execute the following command
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

# Check whether the settings take effect
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

2.1 Set up NAT forwarding rules (choose one of the two)

```shell
systemctl stop firewalld.service
systemctl disable firewalld.service

# The new version supports automatic setting of NAT forwarding. If you have other needs, you can refer to the following command configuration.

# Please replace eth0 according to the server's internal network card
# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.90.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
# If the first command does not take effect, you can continue to execute the following command
# iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -s 192.168.90.0/24 -j ACCEPT
# Check whether the settings take effect
# iptables -nL -t nat
```

2.2 Use global routing for forwarding (choose one of the two)

```shell
# Assume that anylink is on the server
Serverâ€™s internal IP: 10.1.2.10

# First turn off the nat forwarding function
iptables_nat = false

# For traditional network architecture, add the following static routing rules to the H3C switch
ip route-static 192.168.90.0 255.255.255.0 10.1.2.10
# For switch commands of other brands, please refer to the following address
https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/62007

# In a public cloud environment, you need to set up the routing table under vpc and add the following routing policy
Destination: 192.168.90.0/24
Next hop type: Cloud server
Next hop: 10.1.2.10

```

3. Use the AnyConnect client to connect

#### Bridge settings

1. Set up the configuration file

> macvtap setting is relatively simple, you only need to configure the corresponding parameters.
>
> Network requirements: The network needs to support ARP transmission, and ordinary intranet IP can be announced through ARP.
>
> Network restrictions: cannot be used in cloud environment, cannot be used in network card mac plus white environment, cannot be used in 802.1x certified network
>
> The following parameters can be viewed by executing `ip a`


1.1 arp_proxy

```

# file: /etc/sysctl.conf
net.ipv4.conf.all.proxy_arp = 1

# Execute the following command
sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.proxy_arp=1


Configuration file modification:

# First turn off the nat forwarding function
iptables_nat = false


link_mode = "tun"
# Internal network main network card name
ipv4_master = "eth0"
# The following network segments need to be set the same as the ipv4_master network card
ipv4_cidr = "10.1.2.0/24"
ipv4_gateway = "10.1.2.99"
ipv4_start = "10.1.2.100"
ipv4_end = "10.1.2.200"

```

1.2 macvtap

```

# Command line execution master network card needs to turn on promiscuous mode
ip link set dev eth0 promisc on

#=====================#

# Configuration file modification
# First turn off the nat forwarding function
iptables_nat = false

link_mode = "macvtap"
# Internal network main network card name
ipv4_master = "eth0"
# The following network segments need to be set the same as the ipv4_master network card
ipv4_cidr = "10.1.2.0/24"
ipv4_gateway = "10.1.2.1"
ipv4_start = "10.1.2.100"
ipv4_end = "10.1.2.200"
```
